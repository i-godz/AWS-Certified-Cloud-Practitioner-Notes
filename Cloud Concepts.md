# What is Cloud Computing?
 - The <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">on-demand</mark> delivery of the compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources over the internet.
 - Through a cloud service platform with <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">pay-as-you-go</mark> pricing.
 - You can <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">provision exactly the right type</mark> and <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">size of computing resources</mark> you need.
 - You can access as many resources as you need,<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;"> almost instantly</mark>.
 - Simply way to access <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">servers, storage, database</mark> and a set of <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">applications services</mark>.
### Why Cloud Computing?
- There are many problems with the traditional IT approach
    - Covering the costs of data center rental.
    - Covering expenses for power supply, cooling, and maintenance.
    - Time required for hardware additions and replacements.
    - Cannot scale as flexibly as you would likeâ€¦
    - Employing a 24/7 team for infrastructure monitoring.
    - Addressing disaster preparedness concerns such as earthquakes, power shutdowns, and fires.
    - Overall, inflexible and inconvenient for our rapidly changing world.
### Deployment Models of the Cloud
| Private Cloud                                                            | Public Cloud                                                                                             | Hybrid Cloud                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public. | Cloud resources owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider, delivered over the Internet. | Keep some servers on-premises and extend some capabilities to the cloud.     |
| Complete control over data, security, and compliance.                    | Cost-effective as infrastructure is shared among multiple users.                                         | Allows data and applications to be shared between private and public clouds. |
| Security for sensitive applications, ideal for critical workloads.       | Suitable for less sensitive workloads that require high scalability and availability.                    | Offers flexibility, security, and scalability for different use cases.       |
| Meet specific business needs and compliance requirements.                | No maintenance required as the cloud provider manages the infrastructure.                                | Provides business continuity, disaster recovery, and data backup solutions.  |
### Characteristics of the Cloud Computing 
#### Agility / On-demand self service.
- Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider.
#### High Availability / Broad network access.
- Resources are available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms.
#### Fault Tolerance / Multi-tenancy and Resource Pooling
- Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy.
- Multiple customers are serviced form the same physical resource.
#### Rapid Elasticity and Scalability
- Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed.
- Quickly and easily scale based on demand.
##### Scalability Types 
|                Vertical Scaling (scale up/down)                 |                           Horizontal Scaling (scale out/in)                            |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Involves increasing the capacity of a single server or machine. |      Involves adding more servers or machines to a system to distribute the load.      |
| Upgrades the system's resources, such as CPU, RAM, or storage.  | Expands capacity by increasing the number of nodes rather than upgrading a single one. |
#### Measured Service 
- Usage of resources is measured, and users are charged accurately based on their consumption, ensuring cost efficiency.
### Advantages of Cloud Computing 
- **Cost Savings**: Pay only for the computing power, storage, and other resources you use.
- **Speed and Agility**: Quickly deploy services and resources.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale resources up or down as needed.
- **High Availability**: Highly available architecture for business continuity.
- **Global Reach**: Access services from any geographical region.
- **Security**: AWS provides robust security capabilities to protect your data.

| Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)                                              | Platform as a Service (PaaS)                                                      | Software as a Service (SaaS)                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Offers virtualized computing resources over the internet.                       | Offer a platform for developing, deploying, and managing applications.            | Offers cloud-based product that is run and managed by the service provider.      |
| Offers maximum control over the infrastructure.                                 | Focus on deploying applications without managing underlying infrastructure.       | Accessible over the internet, usually via a web browser.                         |
| Suitable for developers needing control over OS, middleware, and runtime.       | Ideal for developers who want to focus on application development                 | Suitable for users needing access to software without infrastructure management. |
| Examples include Amazon EC2, Azure Virtual Machines, and Google Compute Engine. | Examples include AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Service, and Google App Engine. | Examples include Google Workspace, Microsoft Office 365, and Salesforce.         |
### AWS Pricing Models
AWS follows three fundamental pricing principles based on the pay-as-you-go pricing model:

| Fundamental       | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Compute           | Pay for the compute time you consume. Examples include EC2 instance hours or Lambda invocation duration.                                                             |
| Storage           | Pay for the amount of data stored in the cloud. Examples include S3 storage space and EBS volume usage.                                                              |
| Data Transfer OUT | Pay for data transfer out of the cloud. Data transfer IN is free. This pricing structure solves the issue of expensive data transfer fees in traditional IT systems. |
# AWS Global Infrastructure
### AWS Regions
- All around the world.
- Clusters of data centers.
- Most AWS services are region-scoped. 
### How to choose an AWS region???
When deploying to AWS, there are multiple factors to consider:
- **Compliance:** Ensure the region meets data residency and compliance requirements.
- **Latency:** Choose a region closest to your customers for lower latency.
- **Services Available**: Check which AWS services are offered in each region.
- **Pricing**: Prices vary by region, so choose a region that fits your cost requirements.
### AWS Availability Zones
- Each region has many multiple availability zones (min is 3, max is 6).
- Each availability zones has independent redundant power, networking and connectivity.
- They are separate from each other so that they are isolated from disasters.
- They are connected with high bandwidth , ulta-low latency networking.
### AWS Edge Locations / Points of Presence
- Data centers that hold cached copies of the most popular files.
- Content is delivered to end users with lower latency as amazon has 400+ points of presence in 90+ cities across 40+ countries.
